It's one of their best. In a show already unique and with its own corner of the modern comedy market, this episode stands out as one of the most memorable of the series as a whole. I laughed so hard I about cried. The acting and the writing hit full stride as the gang performs the musical. It's sheer, raw, unapologetic brilliance. The song at the end has been stuck in my head for days.");

(It doesn't much resemble Chutes and Ladders). A drinking game consisting of 3 levels and a 15 minute timer. ","Chardee MacDennis: The Game of Games is a amalgam of all their favorite games, and itâ€™s just as insane, crazy and undecipherable as you would think a game made by this group would be. The game is like a combination of Trivial Pursuit, Hungry Hungry Hippos and drunken Double Dare." );

Good or bad, I always enjoy it when Sunny goes for something new and tries out different styles of comedy. This formula-breaker however was one of the best episodes the show's ever produced. A fast, frantic laugh-fest featuring outstanding work from Charlie Day. ");
